* Phase 2 Project
** Title
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:19>: The title that I have decided upon is the following:
- 'BackToTheDrawingBoard'
** Ideas
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:19>: Here are some major ideas I have for this project:
- This will be a drawing board web app where you can upload images, position them, and resize them
- You can then add tags to images that appear upon a 'hover' event
** Layout
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:20>: The overall layout and component hierarchy will be as follows:
- App.js: This will load all of the components
-- About.js: This will be an informative page that contains just a few headers and paragraphs that describe the web app itself as more of a 'welcome' page
-- Upload.js: This page will contain a related form that will allow the user to upload their given images to the app, which will NOT be persistent but just remain for that specific session
-- Board.js: This will be the primary section of the site where the user can view images, rotate images upon a hover icon, tag them, and favorite them. There will be a filter for favorites as well near the top of the page.
