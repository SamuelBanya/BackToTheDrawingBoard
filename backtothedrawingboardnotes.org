* Phase 2 Project
** Title
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:19>: The title that I have decided upon is the following:
- 'BackToTheDrawingBoard'
** Ideas
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:19>: Here are some major ideas I have for this project:
- This will be a drawing board web app where you can upload images, position them, and resize them
- You can then add tags to images that appear upon a 'hover' event
** Layout
<2022-07-23 Sat 18:20>: The overall layout and component hierarchy will be as follows:
- App.js: This will load all of the components
-- About.js: This will be an informative page that contains just a few headers and paragraphs that describe the web app itself as more of a 'welcome' page
-- Upload.js: This page will contain a related form that will allow the user to upload their given images to the app, which will NOT be persistent but just remain for that specific session
-- Board.js: This will be the primary section of the site where the user can view images, rotate images upon a hover icon, tag them, and favorite them. There will be a filter for favorites as well near the top of the page.
** Routing
<2022-07-23 Sat 19:58>: I need to adjust the routing to add routes in the 'App' component to switch given routes depending on user clicks as well

<2022-07-25 Mon 18:16>: This will include a 'NavBar' component that will display the following links:
- About
- Upload
- Board
** How I Created The Foundation For The App
<2022-07-25 Mon 18:20>: I forgot in my initial steps to create the basic 'create-react-app' as this is responsible for handling a lot of the backend for the necessary React app, so I moved over my files to a temporary directory, and ran this command accordingly:
#+begin_src bash
npx create-react-app react-gh
#+end_src

I then removed all the contents except for 'App.js' and 'index.js'.

I then replaced the contents of 'App.js' with these contents:
#+begin_src bash
function App() {
 return (
 <div>
 <h2>Github Pages</h2>
 <h3>Deploying React to Github</h3>
 </div>
 );
}
export default App;
#+end_src

I then created the 'About.js' component:
#+begin_src js
const About = () => {
 return (
 <div>
 <Link to="/">Home</Link>
 <h2>About Page</h2>
 </div>
 );
}
export default About;
#+end_src

I then did this command accordingly to install the routing components:
#+begin_src bash
npm install react-router-dom
#+end_src

After messing with a few of the internals of the app itself in conjunction to primarily feature the 'HashRouter' component so that GitHub Pages properly renders the pages involved, I then ran this npm command to install 'gh-pages' for the project itself:
#+begin_src bash
npm install gh-pages
#+end_src

I then went to the 'package.json' file for the app itself, and added the website's "homepage" key value accordingly:
#+begin_src json
"homepage": "https://samuelbanya.github.io/BackToTheDrawingBoard",
"scripts": {
 "predeploy": "npm run build",
 "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
 "start": "react-scripts start",
 "build": "react-scripts build",
 "test": "react-scripts test",
 "eject": "react-scripts eject"
 }
#+end_src

I then ran the following command to deploy the website:
#+begin_src bash
npm run deploy
#+end_src
